# Project Introduction

Dtail is a command-line tool similar to tail -f but focuses on the contents generated by the most recent file in a
folder. It displays the newly added contents of the most recent file in a folder in real-time and automatically tracks
the most recent file in the folder.

# Quick start

Add a shortcut for an absolute folder path.

    dtail qaf add logall /log/all/path

View the newly added shortcut using the command.

    dtail qaf list

Output:

```
+----------+--------------------------------+
| SHORTCUT | FOLDER PATH                    |
+----------+--------------------------------+
| logall   | /log/all/path                  |
+----------+--------------------------------+
```

Start working with the shortcut.

    dtail watch logall
