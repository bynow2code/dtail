# Project Introduction
Dtail is a command-line tool similar to the unix command tail -f, with the difference that dtail is designed for folder.
Dtail continuously monitors the latest text written in a directory and outputs it to the terminal for display, making it especially suitable for project directories that continue to write content and archive it on an hourly or other time-based schedule.
